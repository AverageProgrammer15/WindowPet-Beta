    I actually made this logs.txt quite late cuz I only thought of making a log just now. I started making this since August 15, 2025.

    Anyways I made a lot of progress on the thing. I originally wanted this to be a simple vpet-like game but the project ended up being like those Raise a Floppa type game. Those type of games are kinda dead, but for some ass reason I still wanna continue it. Anyways, as of writing this, I am now implementing the King boss. And then after that I plan to add materials cuz I'm planning to add a crafting table where you craft stuff to unlock certain stuff. 

    Bugs? Uhh the pet has a seizure when running from the enemies, the protectors refuse to follow the attack-type when I change it. There is a lag spike whenever the King uses the rain attack. I know there's more but idk them.

    Alright that's it for me today, cya

    Not much progress here since I had to study for FUCKING Filipino.
    Finally added the event starter tho, so that's nice.

    Once I finish implementing the feeder, since it's left as a placeholder, then I'll release a beta for the game on my github (As if people will play this lollollol).

    I'll try to make some good progress tommorow. I do have assessments to study for, but I'll try to work on this during break times in school

    Anyways, that's all for now. Sorry if it's short asf cuz of busy stuff

    And as always, to whoever is reading this, have a good day.

    p.s. looking at my code now, this shi is a bit ass, might change this if I have the motivation.

    Ehhh not that much was made as well today, but I was able to do the thing I would do before releasing this.

    Firstly, I finally fixed the feeding section, now u need to pay to feed the pet.

    Secondly, I also added more variety of songs. Majority of them come from those Roblox games I play. Also when the song changes, it gives a lil popup notification for you. Took me a while to fix the song label to display the right song, but atleast it's not as bad as the other bugs. I might make it a bit better in the future, like displaying "Luck from Item Asylum" instead of just the .mp3 file and smth like that.

    Anyways, just a few more tweaks then I'll upload this alr. I'll just adjust the prices and then just push this in my github.

    Alr, cya.

    I'm almost done with this, almost ready for demo. I just have to adjust the prices of the items. Cuz some items are way too easy to get.

    Not that much today, so yeah cya.
